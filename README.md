## Technologies
For this project I chose to use vinilla javaScript, CSS and HTML. Object oriented programming.


## Approach
I took a object approach to solving this problem. There are 2 objects a player and a monster object.
Most functions associated with the objects are put into their respective prototypes.
Game is centered around triggering functions to perpetuate game based on user interaction.

## Basic instructions
Load up game. Select character name. Press play when ready to enter battle. Press attack button (sword on spell bar). Attempt to defeat foes.
If sucsessful you will recieve xp and level up if you get enough experience. Feel free to press save and return to your game anytime.
